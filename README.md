# Harap_Alb-s_Revenge

Harap Alb's Revenge is a 2D Pixel Art platformer that I have created as my 2017 final year Thesis Project.
The player has to survive 3 rounds while being attacked by mosnters, each round becoming more difficult.

- The game was made in Unity using C#
- I implemented the Enemy AI using the A* Pathfinding algorithm

Some of the scripts for this game include: Arm Rotation, Camera Follow, Camera Shake, Enemies, Enemies AI, Lives Counter, Background Prallaxing, Wave Spawner, Weapon.
